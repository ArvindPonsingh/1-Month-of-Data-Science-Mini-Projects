# 1-Month-of-Data-Science-Mini-Projects
30-Day Data Science Challenge 🚀

🎉 This repository is my exciting journey through 30 days of data science, exploring topics ranging from simple linear regression to advanced techniques like Gradient Boosting and beyond! 🌟
What's Inside? 🤔

    🌟 Day 1 to Day 30: Each day focuses on a new concept in data science, with code and explanations.
    📊 Hands-on projects and mini-analyses.
    🎯 My progress and learning highlights.

Highlights 💡

    Day 1: Linear Regression – Kicking things off with the basics!
    Day 10: Clustering with DBSCAN – Fun with density-based techniques!
    Day 23: Gradient Boosting – Power-packed modeling!
    ... and much more! 🚀



Because data science is a mix of chaos and beauty, and this repo captures that perfectly.
